# GifTastic

Using the GIPHY API, I made a dynamic web page that pre-populates with 4 The Simpsons themed gifs buttons. 

A user can type in their own Simpsons character and hit the submit button to create a new character buttton. 

If the user clicks on an existing or created button, a list of 25 gifs populate on the page. 

The user can click on each gif to trigger animation or to stop animation.
